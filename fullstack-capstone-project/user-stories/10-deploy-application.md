**As a** product owner
**I need** to deploy the backend and frontend to a cloud platform
**So that** users can access the GiftLink application from anywhere

### Details and Assumptions
* Frontend can be deployed to services like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS S3
* Backend can be deployed to Heroku, AWS, or similar platforms
* MongoDB can use MongoDB Atlas or similar cloud database service
* Environment variables should be properly configured for production
* HTTPS should be enabled for secure communication
* CI/CD pipeline should be set up for automated deployments

### Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Given the application is containerized and ready for deployment
When I deploy the backend service to the cloud platform
Then the backend should be accessible via a public URL
And all API endpoints should work correctly
And the database connection should be stable

Given the backend is deployed
When I deploy the frontend to the cloud platform
Then the frontend should be accessible via a public URL
And it should successfully communicate with the backend API
And all features should work as expected in production
```
