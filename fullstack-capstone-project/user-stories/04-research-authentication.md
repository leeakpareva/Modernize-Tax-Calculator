**As a** developer
**I need** to research authentication methods in React and Express
**So that** I can implement secure user authentication for the GiftLink application

### Details and Assumptions
* Research should cover JWT tokens, session management, and OAuth
* Should investigate React authentication libraries (e.g., Auth0, Passport.js)
* Need to understand secure password hashing (bcrypt)
* Should document findings and recommended approach

### Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Given I need to implement authentication
When I complete the research
Then I should have documentation of at least 3 authentication approaches
And I should have a recommended implementation strategy
And I should understand the security implications of each approach
And I should have sample code or proof of concept
```

**Labels:** backlog, technical debt
